# README: Explanation of Attention Models

Welcome to the **Explanation of Attention Models** repository! This project provides an intuitive guide to understanding semantic embeddings and the attention mechanism in natural language processing.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Semantic Embeddings
Semantic embeddings are vectors that represent the meaning of words. Words with similar meanings are close to each other in this vector space. We use the Word2Vec Skip-gram model to create these embeddings.

### 2. Attention Mechanism
The attention mechanism helps a model focus on relevant words when understanding the context of a sentence. It adjusts the word vectors based on their importance to each other in the sentence.

## Example Sentence: "bat in the cave"

### Semantic Embeddings
- Each word in the sentence is initially represented by a vector that captures its meaning.
- Example: "bat" is represented by a vector based on its usage in various contexts.

### Attention Mechanism
- The model calculates how much each word in the sentence contributes to the meaning of the target word.
- For instance, the word "cave" has a significant impact on the meaning of "bat" compared to words like "in" and "the".

## Visualization

The provided notebook visualizes how the vectors (embeddings) of words move when the attention mechanism is applied.
- **Original Vectors**: Represented by solid lines.
- **Adjusted Vectors**: Represented by dashed lines, showing the influence of context.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib)

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/explanation_of_attention_models.git
   cd explanation_of_attention_models
   ```

2. Install the required packages (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook "Explanation of attention models.ipynb"
   ```

### Explanation of Attention Models.ipynb

This notebook provides:
- A clear explanation of semantic embeddings and how they are created using the Word2Vec Skip-gram model.
- An intuitive demonstration of how the attention mechanism adjusts these embeddings to create context-aware word vectors.
- Visualizations to help you see how the meaning of words like "bat" changes in the context of the sentence "bat in the cave".

## Summary

This project aims to make the concepts of semantic embeddings and attention mechanisms accessible and easy to understand through clear explanations and visual demonstrations. By the end of the notebook, you will have a solid understanding of how these fundamental concepts work in natural language processing.

Happy learning! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out or open an issue.
